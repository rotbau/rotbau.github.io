I'm a solutions engineer working for a large Silicon Valley software company.  I'm also a Kubernetes nerd who still enjoys working with hardware and running my own lab at home.  This blog is really a place for me to capture things I'm working on and hopefully it will help a few figure out something they are working on too.

CKA and CKAD with roots in virtualization, networking and Cloud architecture.
