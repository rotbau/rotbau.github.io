I'm a solutions engineer working for a large Silicon Valley software company.  I'm also a Kubernetes nerd and hardware junkie that still loves listening to the drone of fans and watching all the blinky lights.  I remember working for a large fortune 50 company and having data center access.  On Fridays we'd all go down to one of the on-premise datacenters and just walk the isles looking at all the cool stuff (old and new).  Doubt that would happen now days as security has tightened up quite a bit.

This blog is really a place for me to capture things I'm working on and hopefully it will help a few figure out something they are working on too.

I'm a CKA and CKAD with roots in virtualization, networking and Cloud architecture.
